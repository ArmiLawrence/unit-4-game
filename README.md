# unit-4-game

1. Game is called "Defeat the Villain!"

2. The player will have to guess the answer, just like in Word Guess. This time, though, the player will guess with numbers instead of letters. 

3. Here's how the app works:

   * There will be four images displayed as buttons on the page.

   * The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

   * When the player clicks on the image, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 

   * The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

   * The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

   * The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

   * The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.
